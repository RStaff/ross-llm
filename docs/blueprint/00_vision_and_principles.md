# Ross-LLM – Long-Horizon Blueprint (No Fixed Timeline)

This repo is the **root OS** for Ross’s future agents and AI products.

**Principles:**
- No fixed years. Progress is **phase-based**, not time-based.
- Automate everything twice: once for Ross, once for clients.
- Source-of-truth lives in **this repo**, never only in someone’s head.
- AI is a *team member*, not a toy: every feature must reduce real cognitive or operational load.

**Core Pillars:**
1. Personal AI OS (Ross-LLM Core)
2. Shopify / Abando Autonomous Agent
3. DevOps / Infra Agent
4. Life Archive & Therapy Companion
5. Agent Swarm / Orchestrator (future control plane)

Use this file only to refine **why** you’re building, not the technical details.
