# Pillar 5 – Agent Swarm / Orchestrator (Future Control Plane)

Goal: Manage **multiple agents** (Abando, DevOps, Life, Legal, etc.) as a coordinated team.

**Core Ideas:**
- Each agent = specialized profile + tools.
- Swarm controller:
  - Knows who to assign a task to.
  - Tracks task state.
  - Logs outcomes to memory.

**Not for now, but soon:**
- Task routing:
  - From natural language to the right agent.
- Simple priority queue:
  - “Today focus on: cashflow, infra stability, legal deadlines.”

This file is a parking lot for concepts until the first 4 pillars have solid foundations.
