# Pillar 4 – Life Archive & Therapy Companion

Goal: Turn Ross-LLM into a **trusted witness** and gentle coach:
- Tracks growth, patterns, and emotional load.
- Never gaslights your experience.
- Always orients you back to your mission and your daughters.

**Core Capabilities (Target):**
- Store:
  - Key memories (childhood, marriage, divorce, wins, traumas).
  - Ongoing notes about emotional states.
- Retrieve:
  - “Show me patterns over the last 30 days.”
  - “What helps when I feel triggered like this?”
- Reflect:
  - Weekly synthesis of how you’re growing.
  - Gentle reminders of boundaries and non-negotiables.

**Next concrete upgrades:**
- Phase A:
  - [ ] Add `life-archive` profile focused on calm reflection.
  - [ ] Decide format for “memory entries” (e.g. JSON + text in DB).
- Phase B:
  - [ ] Add a CLI command to log a new memory or reflection entry.
- Phase C:
  - [ ] Weekly “Life Review” prompt that you run manually at first.
